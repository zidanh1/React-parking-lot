## User Stories

As a busy professional,

I want to temporarily save my unused tabs in a parking lot,
so that I can declutter my workspace and return to them when I have more time.

As a research student,
I want to categorize and organize my parked tabs,
so that I can quickly find the information I need when I resume my research.

As a frequent traveler,
I want my parked tabs to sync across all my devices,
so that I can access my saved tabs from anywhere, on any device.
